[JEST](https://jestjs.io/)

## TypeScript with Jest

You have to follow the documentation to use TypeScript.

https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript

Babel is required.

## Other Options

I don't use Jest anymore, there are better options like vitest, bun test, deno test. They all have native TypeScript support, saving a lot of effort from messing with jest.
