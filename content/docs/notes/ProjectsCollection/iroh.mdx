> Iroh is a library for building on direct connections between devices, putting more control in the hands of your users.

It's like Magic Wormhole, but more general purpose, not just for sending files.

For hosts that are impossible to connect directly, it fallbacks to use a relay server.

It's written in Rust, which is great. I can use it to build low-level high performance services without worrying about memory safety.

With FFI, like napi-rs, it can be used from other languages.

## Sample Projects

- [Dumbpipe](https://www.dumbpipe.dev/)
  - > Easy, direct connections that punch through NATs & stay connected as network conditions change.
- [Sendme](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme)
  - Use [`iroh-blobs`](https://www.iroh.computer/proto/iroh-blobs) to send files over P2P network, just like Magic Wormhole.
