## Starlight Obsidian

This astro starlight plugin is almost perfect

## Quartz 4

Quartz is like a 1:1 clone of obsidian publish.

It supports graph view, wikilinks and Embeds. The only drawback is that it doesn’t have a modern UI. I wanted to customize its UI, but if I can get the same features working in starlight or fumadocs, I wouldn’t need to worry about customizing UI.

## Obsidian Dataview

I can’t get this one working. I never used this feature in obsidian, but it could be very powerful.

## remark-wiki-link

https://github.com/datopian/portaljs/tree/main/packages/remark-wiki-link

This remark plugin is used in https://flowershow.app/

## Flowershow

https://flowershow.app/

I didn’t get it working, but it used `remark-wiki-link`.
